  \begin{block}{Simplest Form}
    Let $$\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1.$$ \pause
    Using the positive solution of that equation, $\varphi \approx 1.618$, we can show that $0.11_\varphi = 1.00_\varphi$ by using a beta expansion. \pause
    $$0.11_\varphi = 1\times\varphi^{-1} + 1\times\varphi^{-2} = \frac{1}{\varphi} + \frac{1}{\varphi^2}.$$ \pause
    Then,
    $$\frac{\varphi}{\varphi^2} + \frac{1}{\varphi^2} = \frac{\varphi+1}{\varphi^2},$$\pause

    Using our previous example:
    $$T(0.011_\varphi)=0.11_\varphi=1.00_\varphi.$$ \pause

    But that can't happen! By definition, $T:[0,1)\to[0,1)$. As such, we say that this is a forbidden word. \pause

    Geometrically, this can't happen. If we multiply a number in [0,1) by any number and perform (mod 1), we will never get a number larger than one.

\begin{frame}{Finding Forbidden Words}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The orbit of one is composed of the maximum allowed numeral in a language \pause
    \item All the forbidden words then will subwords of the orbit, with one added until the word is the maximum numeral lexicographically possible
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Language Generated by base Golden Ratio}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $0.\overline{10}_\varphi$ is the orbit of one in base golden ratio \pause
    \item Since the maximum allowed numeral in the language is 10, we add one and find that the forbidden word is 11 \pause
    \item There can be more than one forbidden word, but since the maximum lexicographically allowed numeral in base golden ratio is 1, we can't add one again \pause
    \item With this in mind, we can now create a finite state machine
